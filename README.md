Iron Throne
===========

> When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.

-- Cersei Lannister

The Iron Throne is a claim-based NLU engine. We don't try to dive into grammar
but instead make the assumption that if your domain is contextual enough you
can simply spot words in a sentence and deduce entities from that.

Key benefits:

- Very simple to understand
- Easy to customize for specific needs
- Training is really fast
- Bullshit is kept away
